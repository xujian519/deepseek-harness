/**
 * Pure payload builders for the "add selection to conversation" popup in the
 * text viewers (markdown preview + the catch-all code viewer). Everything
 * here is string math — no React, no ctx — so the unit tests cover it
 * directly.
 *
 * Insert shape (agreed with the product owner):
 * - Selection ≤ SELECTION_LIMIT characters: a fenced code block whose info
 *   line is `相对路径:起止行` and whose body is the selected text.
 * - Selection over the limit: a single plain-text line `相对路径:起止行`
 *   (no fence, no content).
 * - The path is relative to the session cwd (the same projection the
 *   explorer's @ button uses); an unknown cwd falls back to the absolute
 *   path.
 * - Line numbers: single-line selections write `path:12`, multi-line write
 *   `path:12-15`. The markdown preview cannot map rendered DOM back to
 *   source lines directly, so it reverse-searches the selected text in the
 *   source and only reports lines on an unambiguous hit (see
 *   {@link linesOfSelection}).
