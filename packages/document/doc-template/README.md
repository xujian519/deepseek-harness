# @deepseek-ai/dsh-doc-template

English | [中文](README.zh.md)

## Summary

`@deepseek-ai/dsh-doc-template` loads the document templates shipped with the harness and renders the one a caller selects. Each template is a Markdown asset whose YAML front-matter declares its category, domain, language, writing style, supported formats, and variable schema; its body fills `{{snake_case}}` placeholders from the variables the call supplies. Rendering returns the document together with the placeholders that stayed unfilled and the variable warnings, so a caller can tell a complete document from an incomplete one without re-parsing it.

## Template assets

Seventeen templates ship under `assets/templates/<category>/`, in five categories: `patent-report` (5), `specification` (4), `claims` (3), `oa-response` (3), and `disclosure` (2). All of them are Chinese and declare `language: zh-CN`; the legal category of the upstream project is not part of this batch.

Front-matter fields, all read from the upstream template contract:

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `name` | Template name, unique within a store; required. |
| `title` | Document title, used as the renderer's level-1 heading. |
| `category` | Document category, which selects the style disclaimer. |
| `description` | One-line description shown to the model. |
| `domain` | Domain the template belongs to, e.g. `patent`. |
| `version` | Template version. |
| `language` | Language the body is written in; empty means the deployment default applies. |
| `style` | Writing style name, resolved against the loaded styles. |
| `use_when` | When the template should be used. |
| `formats` | Supported render formats; absent means Markdown only. |
| `vars` | Variable definitions, each with `name`, `type`, `required`, `default`, and `description`. |
| `changelog` | Change history, each entry with `version`, `date`, and `description`. |
| `shared_vars` | Variables shared with the templates this one is composed with. |
| `extends` | Template names this template extends. |

A variable's `type` is one of `string`, `multiline`, `number`, or `bool`; an absent type is a single-line string. `language` is the only field this batch added to the upstream assets, and `formats` was written out explicitly where the upstream asset relied on the implicit Markdown-only default.

<a id="list_doc_templates-tool"></a>
## list_doc_templates tool

`list_doc_templates` returns the renderable templates with their variable schema, in category order (patent-report, specification, claims, oa-response, disclosure) and then by name. The optional filters `category`, `domain`, `language`, and `query` combine; `query` is a case-insensitive substring matched against the name, title, description, and use-when text. The language of a template is its declared `language`, or the deployment default when it declares none.

<a id="render_doc_template-tool"></a>
## render_doc_template tool

`render_doc_template` resolves one template's variables and renders it. The result carries the rendered document, the suggested file name, the content type, the encoding, the resolved Markdown body, the residual placeholders, and the validation warnings. `format` defaults to Markdown and must be one the template declares; `title`, `author`, `date`, and `filename` override the template's own values.

The call fails rather than returning a degraded document for an unknown template, an unknown style name, a format the template does not support, a variable whose value is not a string, and a missing required variable. A type mismatch and an unfilled placeholder are not failures: they are reported as a warning and as a residual placeholder, because a caller may still want the partially filled document.

<a id="variable-resolution"></a>
## Variable resolution

`validatedResolve(template, variables)` is the upstream pipeline, unchanged: validate, apply defaults, substitute, then report what is left.

- `VarSchema.validate` reports a missing required variable before its type, since an absent value has no type, and reports `invalid_type` for a value that is not a number or not `true`/`false`.
- `VarSchema.applyDefaults` copies the variables and fills the declared defaults; an empty default is no default.
- `substitutePlaceholders` replaces only the placeholders it has a value for, so an unfilled placeholder stays in the text.
- The returned `residual` lists every distinct `{{snake_case}}` placeholder still present, in first-occurrence order, and `warnings` lists the validation issues in declaration order.

Upstream returned both lists to the caller and stopped there. This package keeps that pipeline and adds one decision above it: the render path turns a `missing_required` warning into an error, because a document missing a required variable is not a document a caller should deliver. The residual list is the deterministic evidence a document gate reads; it is reported for every successful render.

<a id="renderers"></a>
## Renderers

Three renderers ship, registered by format.

- `markdown` passes the resolved body through, prefixed with the style disclaimer and, when the body has no level-1 heading of its own, the document title.
- `html` converts the body with `marked` (GFM, hard line breaks) into a standalone document, with the patent A4 stylesheet for a patent style name and a screen stylesheet otherwise. Variable values are HTML-escaped before substitution in this format only, because the converter passes the templates' own raw HTML through.
- `docx` delegates to `@deepseek-ai/dsh-docx-kit`, which writes the same OOXML package the upstream renderer wrote.

No PDF renderer ships. The upstream project had three: a Chrome one, a LibreOffice one, and a third of its own. The harness already owns a Chrome path and a LibreOffice path, so a third would duplicate both, and `pdf` is not an output format of this package.

<a id="configuration"></a>
## Configuration

Schemastery configuration, every field optional.

| Key | Type | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `templateDirs` | string[] | `[]` | Extra template roots, resolved against the working directory and layered after the packaged root. A later root overrides a template of the same name. |
| `styleDirs` | string[] | `[]` | Extra style directories, layered after the packaged one in ascending precedence. |
| `defaultLanguage` | string | `zh-CN` | Language a template that declares none renders in. |
| `includeDisclaimer` | boolean | `true` | Whether the style disclaimer is injected into rendered documents. |
| `styleGuide` | string | `''` | Loaded style name whose guide is injected as a system-prompt section; empty injects none. |
| `styleSectionOrder` | number | `100` | Position of the injected guide in the assembled system prompt. |

Every listed directory must exist: a configured root that is missing fails the plugin load rather than falling back to the packaged assets unnoticed. A `styleGuide` name no loaded style carries also fails the load, because a guide that silently does not apply would leave the model writing against a style no checker agrees with.

## Model Experience

### Injected style guide

#### What the model sees

When the deployment names a `styleGuide`, that style's guide enters the system prompt: the tone, the voice principles, the forbidden words with their replacements, the disclaimers, the citation rules, and the output conventions the style declares. The document preset points it at `assistant-neutral` and [`@deepseek-ai/dsh-document-deliver`](../document-deliver/README.md) checks registrations against the same style, so the words the model is told to avoid and the words the gate refuses are one list.

#### Token effect

Fixed cost on every request of the agent that mounted the plugin: the shipped `assistant-neutral` guide is 428 characters over 20 lines, and `patent-standard` is 1222 characters over 40 lines. A deployment that wants no fixed cost leaves `styleGuide` empty; the forbidden words then reach the model only through the delivery gate's findings, which is why turning the guide off while keeping the gate on is recorded below as a limitation rather than recommended.

#### KV Cache effect

The section is static text, so it sits in the prefix: registering or removing the guide changes the prefix once, and nothing per request changes it afterwards.

### render_doc_template result

#### What the model sees

The `render_doc_template` tool definition and its result. The result text names the template, the format, the suggested file name, the content type, and the encoding, then the residual placeholders and the warnings, then the document. A base64 DOCX result reports the package's size instead of printing it, and shows the resolved Markdown as the readable document.

#### Token effect

Fixed definition cost on every request while the tool is enabled, plus the rendered document, which is the largest thing this plugin puts in a request: a complete patent template renders to a few thousand tokens. The result is resent only until compaction.

#### KV Cache effect

Append-only; the tool definition and the rendered result follow the reusable request prefix and do not invalidate existing KV-cache entries.

### list_doc_templates result

#### What the model sees

The `list_doc_templates` tool definition and its result, one line group per template: category, name, title, description, formats, language, style, and each variable with its type, requiredness, and default. An empty filter result answers with one sentence naming no template.

#### Token effect

Fixed definition cost on every request while the tool is enabled, plus one short line group per matching template — a few hundred tokens for the shipped catalog, which is why the catalog is filtered rather than dumped whole.

#### KV Cache effect

Append-only; the listing follows the reusable request prefix and does not invalidate existing KV-cache entries.

## Known Limitations and Deferred Work

- **Twelve templates declare no variables** — the claims, specification, oa-response, and disclosure assets upstream carry a `填写指引` section in their bodies instead of a `vars` block, so `list_doc_templates` reports no variables for them and a render reports their placeholders as residual. The model fills them from the residual list or from the asset's own guidance; transcribing the guidance into `vars` declarations is deferred rather than invented here.
- **The patent-report templates render to Markdown and HTML only** — their bodies carry HTML metadata blocks (`<div class="doc-meta">`, `<div class="callout">`), which a DOCX package cannot reproduce, so `docx` is deliberately absent from their `formats`. The other twelve render to all three formats.
- **Only one template per name** — a store keeps one entry per name, so a language variant needs its own name, as the upstream store documented. `findByNameAndLanguage` therefore filters the single entry rather than selecting among variants.
- **Template version drift is reported, not resolved** — `listConflicts` names an override whose version differs from the first-loaded one; nothing consumes it yet, and no template is merged or downgraded.
- **`systemPromptForTemplate` has no consumer yet** — the template-context projection of [`@deepseek-ai/dsh-doc-style`](../doc-style/README.md) is available, but the style guide this package injects is the template-free one (`systemPrompt`) and the render path uses `toRenderStyle` and `disclaimerFor` only.
- **The injected guide is not per template** — one agent reads one guide, chosen at load; a deployment that composes templates across styles gets the guide of the configured style and the disclaimer of each template's own, which the render path resolves separately.
- **An empty `styleGuide` leaves the gate unannounced** — [`@deepseek-ai/dsh-document-deliver`](../document-deliver/README.md) refuses a word its style marks `block` whether or not the model was shown the guide, so a deployment that enables the checks and injects no guide can refuse a registration the model had no way to predict. Set `styleGuide` to the style the gate uses.
- **The shipped templates are Chinese only** — the assets self-describe with `language: zh-CN` and no bilingual twin ships, so a document in another language needs its own template asset.
- **`mergeVarContext` has no consumer yet** — the merged variable space of several templates is available to a caller that composes them; no shipped tool composes templates. Its `sharedVars` and `allVars` follow first-appearance order, not a sorted one.
- **`rendererRegistry` has no consumer yet** — the store hands out the registry a consumer would call to add a render format; every shipped format is registered at construction, so nothing reads it.
- **DOCX bytes travel base64** — a `docx` result carries the package base64-encoded in its `content` field, which is roughly a third larger than the package; the tool text keeps the package out of the transcript.

### Dev Note

The package is a rewrite of six files of the MIT-licensed Go project Mady: `domains/doctmpl/loader.go`, `vars.go`, `store.go`, `format.go`, `renderer_registry.go`, `renderer_html.go`, `renderer_markdown.go`, and `renderer_docx.go`, plus the twenty-two templates of `domains/doctmpl/templates/` and the twenty of `doc-templates/`. Several deliberate differences are recorded in the module JSDoc of the modules they touch: an unknown format name fails the load where upstream dropped it, a duplicate name inside one asset root fails the load where upstream kept the first, `DocIndex` is not ported because the structured listing supersedes its presentation string, and the DOCX renderer delegates to `@deepseek-ai/dsh-docx-kit` instead of carrying a second OOXML writer.

No companion is published because the package owns no durable state or event: both tools are pure functions over the assets loaded at plugin load, and a missing or invalid asset fails that load.
