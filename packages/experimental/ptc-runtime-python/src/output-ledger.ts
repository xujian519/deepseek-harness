   * Flush a pipe's residual into `lines`, called on the combined-budget
   * threshold above, on the pipe's `end` (normal drain), and — for the
   * setsid-escapee path where destroy() forces settlement without an `end` —
   * explicitly in the closeDeadline handler. Idempotent: it clears what it
   * admits, so a later flush is a no-op, and it returns early on an empty
   * buffer so flushing the sibling that had nothing pending is a no-op. The
   * `chunks`/`blocks` guard is the only emptiness check needed — `data` never
   * emits a zero-length Buffer, so a non-empty fragment list always decodes to
   * a non-empty tail.
   *
   * `retainPartialTail` is true only on the budget-triggered path: there the
   * residual can end at an ARBITRARY pipe boundary, so if the incomplete
   * trailing bytes of a UTF-8 lead sequence are pending (`stray.utf8.expected
   * > 0`), they are withheld from the decode and re-carried on `chunks` for a
   * later chunk to complete — decoding them here would render a LEGAL,
   * un-finished character as U+FFFD in an admitted entry, and the next chunk's
   * bytes would then each independently break into more U+FFFD. The withheld
   * tail is `stray.utf8.width - stray.utf8.expected` bytes (the lead plus the
   * continuations consumed so far), at most 3; `stray.utf8` is reset and the
   * withheld tail re-accrued so the next chunk continues the walk correctly.
   * The `end`/closeDeadline paths pass `false`: there a trailing incomplete
   * sequence is real truncated input and the U+FFFD is the honest render.
   * @param stray - the pipe accumulator to drain.
   * @param retainPartialTail - withhold an in-progress trailing sequence.
