/**
 * Model-call logging for the patent pipeline: one `patent/model-call` session
 * event per call the pipeline issues through the harness LLM seam.
 *
 * The agent loop logs its own calls as `request/*` + `assistant/*`; a model call
 * a patent tool makes inside its body has no such event, which leaves the
 * request invisible to the session log and the keyless replay unable to rebuild
 * the call order. Every LLM-consuming patent tool therefore wraps its port with
 * {@link loggedPatentModel} before passing it to atoms, the graph, or a stage
 * executor.

/**
 * Wrap one port so every call it serves appends a `patent/model-call` event to
 * the calling agent's session. Without an agent (direct library use, unit
 * tests) the port is returned unchanged, so a caller never has to branch on
 * session availability.
 *
 * The event is appended after the wrapped stream ends: a consumer that stops
 * early or a provider that fails mid-stream leaves no record, matching what a
 * replay can serve (the recorded output is the complete visible text).
 * @param port - the port to wrap.
 * @param agent - the calling agent whose session records the calls, when present.
 * @param context - static labels recorded on every call this port serves.
 * @returns the logging port, or `port` itself without an agent.
