/**
 * The approval seam for the two team mutations a case owner decides: creating a team and

 * The captain is the calling model, so it creates and deletes teams itself; a deployment
 * that wants the user to make those two decisions turns on the matching `Config` flag, and
 * the tool layer asks the mounted `approval` service for one decision before the mutation
 * runs. A missing answerer is a refusal rather than a pass: a fail-open path would be dead
 * on exactly the deployments that asked for the decision, which is why both outcomes raise
 * the same error type.
