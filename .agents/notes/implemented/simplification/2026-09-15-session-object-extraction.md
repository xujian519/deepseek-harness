# Agent Note: Extracting the `Session` object and the publication observers (Issue #86)

Status: implemented

English | [中文](2026-09-15-session-object-extraction.zh.md)

## Problem

`packages/core/session/src/index.ts` was 904 lines, and three subjects shared it: the `Context`/`Events` declarations and the `SessionStore` service, the `Session` object, and the listener-dispatch helpers both publication paths call. The class alone was 382 lines (126–507), and the store read three more things from the same module: the `SessionEntry`/`attachments` pair its `enter`, `detachEntered`, and `liveEntryFor` write and read, and the observers `announce`, `emitDisposed`, and `flush` resolve.

[The split plan](../../proposed/simplification/2026-09-14-god-file-split-plan.md) holds this cut in batch 3 and names its two constraints: `attachments` and `SessionEntry` must stay co-located, and the class's type string is asserted verbatim by `tests/typert.spec.ts`.

## Decision

`packages/core/session/src/session.ts` (425 lines) and `packages/core/session/src/observers.ts` (44 lines) are new; `index.ts` is 488 lines.

| Moved | Form in the new module |
| --- | --- |
| `Session` (126–507) | `session.ts`, re-exported by the entry, its `@typert object` tag intact |
| `SessionEntry`, `attachments` (113–124) | `session.ts`, exported for the store that mints and reads them and off the published surface |
| `SessionCallback`, `collectSessionCallbacks`, `invokeContainedSessionObservers` (95–111) | `observers.ts` |

The observers get their own module rather than riding along with `Session` because both sides use them: `Session.append` resolves its `session/event` snapshot through `collectSessionCallbacks` and invokes it contained, and the store does the same for `announce`, `emitDisposed`, and `flush`. Housing them in `session.ts` would have the store import publication machinery from the session's module; the file they now share is what they have in common.

### What stayed, and where

The `@typert object` tag travels with the class, and the type string `@deepseek-ai/dsh-session#Session` stays byte-identical in `SessionStore`'s registration, so `tests/typert.spec.ts` keeps asserting the same literal and the lookup it resolves still works with the class declared elsewhere. The `Context.sessions`, `Events`, and `TypertLookupMap` declarations stay with the store that emits those events, as do `SessionForkSource`, `SessionForkErrorCode`, `SessionForkError`, and the whole fork path. The entry's export list is unchanged: `Session` moves behind `export { Session } from './session.ts'`, and the store keeps importing it for `prepare`.

The moved helpers are exported from their new modules because the store imports them, and none of them is re-exported by the package entry — `exports` still lists only `.`, `./invariant`, `./types`, `./surface`, and `./src/*`. `attachments`' comment said "module-private"; it now says what actually holds, that the pair is off the published surface.

### Tests, and what carries the evidence

No new test is possible from this cut: `Session` is already constructed directly by `tests/session.spec.ts` (1838 lines) through `Session.create` and by every suite that drives a store. The evidence is that the existing suites pass unchanged and that the per-file coverage gate covers both new files: 15 files / 502 tests, no test needed a new import path, and both modules report 100% statements, branches, functions, and lines with no exemption written.

`tests/typert.spec.ts` is the load-bearing one for the class move: it runs the real registry, resolves `hostTypeSymbol: '@deepseek-ai/dsh-session#Session'`, and calls `lookup.resolve(session.id)`, so a move that broke the symbol's resolution would fail there rather than in a type check. `tests/scoped.spec.ts` and `tests/session.spec.ts` exercise the containment paths inside the moved observers, including a throwing listener and the deferred-detach path.

### Verification

| Check | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `pnpm exec vitest run packages/core/session` | 15 files / 502 passed, no test needed a new import path |
| coverage for `src/session.ts` and `src/observers.ts` | 100% statements / branches / functions / lines each, no exemption |
| `pnpm run typecheck` | exit 0 |
| `pnpm exec tsx scripts/run-oxlint.ts packages/core/session/src packages/core/session/tests` | 28 files, 0 warnings, 0 errors |
| `pnpm run verify-export-jsdoc` | every exported name documented |
| `pnpm run duplication` | 0 clones |
| `pnpm run test:docs` | 18/18 |
| `pnpm run doc-sync` | 33 passed / 3 failed — the pre-existing doc graphs, config catalog, and package paths failures |

## Alternatives considered

- **Housing the observer helpers in `session.ts`.** Rejected: the store resolves and invokes listeners for `session/created`, `session/disposed`, and `session/flush` without touching a `Session` object's own machinery, so the helpers would have been imported back out of the session's module for a subject they do not serve.
- **Moving `SessionStore` out and leaving `Session` in the entry.** Rejected: the `Events` and `TypertLookupMap` declarations describe the store's publication protocol, and separating them from the class that emits them would split one protocol across two files.
- **Keeping `attachments` module-private and passing the entry into `Session.append`.** Rejected: the append path reads the attachment on every event, so it would thread a store concern through the store-agnostic public signature the plan's constraint protects.
- **Leaving the two helpers unexported and duplicating them.** Rejected: containment is the invariant under test in `scoped.spec.ts`; two copies could drift and only one would be covered.

## Consequences

`index.ts` loses 416 lines; `session.ts` and `observers.ts` are 425 and 44, so the net growth is two module headers and the export keywords the store now imports through. The store's file is now the store: its declarations, its lifecycle, and its fork path, with the session object and the publication observers read on their own. Batch 3's remaining items are `code-runtime-python`'s config gates and process supervisor, `ui-trajectory`'s row renderer, and `analyzer`, which starts with an id-stability test for `allocateNodeId`.
