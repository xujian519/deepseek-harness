# Agent Note: Extracting the session's incremental folds (Issue #86)

Status: implemented

English | [中文](2026-09-14-session-folds-extraction.zh.md)

## Problem

`packages/core/session/src/index.ts` was 950 lines. The `Session` class owned the event log and, alongside it, three incremental fold caches: the request header in force, the latest resolved route metadata, and the derived LLM message history. The caches and their methods occupy lines 452–542 — 91 lines and six private fields — and share one input, the log array, which the class also appends to.

[The split plan](../../implemented/simplification/2026-09-14-god-file-split-plan.md) puts `core/session` in batch 3, the batch whose cuts sit on semantics and must each show what they preserve. This cut's evidence is the coverage that already exists: `tests/request-header.spec.ts` (10 cases), `tests/derived-cache.spec.ts` (6 cases), and `deriveMessages with surface` in `tests/surface.spec.ts` exercise all three folds through `Session`; the package carries no `jscpd:ignore` symmetry contract, no browser lane, and no coverage exemption, so the per-file gate over `packages/*/*/src` refuses a cut that drops a path instead of failing quietly.

## Decision

`packages/core/session/src/folds.ts` (121 lines) exports `class SessionFolds`; `packages/core/session/src/index.ts` is 904 lines.

| Moved | Form in the new module |
| --- | --- |
| `requestHeader`, `headerFold`, `headerFoldSeq` | `SessionFolds.requestHeader()` |
| `requestContext`, `contextFold`, `contextFoldSeq` | `SessionFolds.requestContext()` |
| `deriveMessages`, `derived`, `derivedNodes`, `derivedGeneration` | `SessionFolds.deriveMessages()` |

The constructor takes the session's live log array and the surface over it: `constructor(log: readonly SessionEvent[], surface: SessionSurface)`. The log is a shared reference, not a copy, so appends by `Session.append` stay visible to the folds and the incremental reads stay incremental. `Session` declares one field, `private readonly folds = new SessionFolds(this.log, this.surfaceManager)`, after `surfaceManager` so field initialization order holds, and keeps `requestHeader`, `requestContext`, and `deriveMessages` as one-line delegations with their public JSDoc intact.

`deriveMessages` reached the per-node projection through `this.deriveEventMessage`, the public instance method; in the new module it calls the `deriveEventMessage` function imported from `./surface.ts` directly. The instance method itself stays on `Session`, where callers and tests reach it.

### What stayed in the entry

`attachments` and `SessionEntry` stay: `Session.append` reads the WeakMap and `SessionStore` writes it, which is the co-location the plan names as a batch-3 constraint for the `Session` cut. The `@typert object` type string stays, because `tests/typert.spec.ts` asserts `@deepseek-ai/dsh-session#Session` verbatim. `Session.surface`, `Session.deriveEventMessage`, and the replace path that resets `eventsSnapshot` are untouched.

### Import movement

`index.ts` no longer imports `foldRequestHeader` — `requestHeader` was its only caller — while its re-export of `foldRequestHeader` from `./request-header.ts` stays. `deepFreeze` still has two callers in the entry (the snapshot replace path and `append`), so its import stays. The entry gained one import, `SessionFolds` from `./folds.ts`.

### Verification

| Check | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `pnpm exec vitest run packages/core/session` | 15 files / 502 passed, no test needed a new import path |
| coverage for `src/folds.ts` | 100% statements / branches / functions / lines, 0 uncovered statements, from the existing specs |
| `pnpm run typecheck` | exit 0 |
| oxlint on `packages/core/session/src` and `tests` | 26 files, 0 warnings, 0 errors |
| `pnpm run verify-export-jsdoc` | every exported name documented |
| `pnpm run duplication` | 0 clones |
| `pnpm run test:docs` | 18 passed |
| `pnpm run doc-sync` | 33 passed / 3 failed — doc graphs, config catalog, and package paths, each reproduced unchanged on the `origin/master` baseline |

No test was added: the existing specs reach every branch of the new module, so the per-file gate is satisfied without a new exemption and without a test written for coverage. The export list of `index.ts` is unchanged — the three methods keep their names, signatures, and documentation, and `SessionFolds` is not re-exported.

## Alternatives considered

- **Moving `deriveEventMessage` (`Session`'s public instance method) with the folds.** Rejected: it is an instance face callers reach as `session.deriveEventMessage(event)`, and moving it would leave `Session` forwarding a one-line pure-function call for no reduction in what the entry owns.
- **One module per fold.** Rejected: the three share the log reference, the same "how far have I read" cache state, and the same construction site; three modules would triple the constructor plumbing and the field declarations to express one idea.
- **Moving `attachments` and `SessionEntry` with the folds.** Rejected: both the append path and `SessionStore` touch the WeakMap, and the plan defers that boundary to the `Session` cut.
- **Creating `src/types.ts` for the fold vocabulary (plan rule 3).** Not applicable: the cuts share no new vocabulary — `SessionFolds` reuses `EpochHeader` and `RequestContext` from the existing `types.ts`, and `Message` from `dsh-llm`.

## Consequences

`index.ts` loses 46 lines and `folds.ts` is 121, so the net growth is the module header plus the class JSDoc. No constant, default, or schema value moved, and every fold's arithmetic (`headerFoldSeq`, `contextFoldSeq`, `derivedNodes`, `derivedGeneration`) is byte-identical to what the entry ran before. The plan's inventory row for `fixture.ts` read 4052 against 2483 in the same document's prose, and the row now reads the measured 2483. Batch 3's remaining items — the `Session` class, the `ptc` dispatch pool, the python runtime's gates and supervisor, the trajectory row renderer, and the analyzer — stay open on Issue #86. The package README source map gained one row in both languages, and the pair's consistency record was re-recorded.
